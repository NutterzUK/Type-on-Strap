GitOps: Versioned CICD on top of declarative infastructure.
Everything managed as code. Config, references, variables, documentation.


Work locally -> Push -> trigger tests etc -> CICD -> Deploy + track back.

Intersection of CI and containers.

 Classic CI -> Push -> trigger -> results
 improved by: Standardisation. dockcer build -t

Add CI to PRs.
improved by: standard
docker build
docker compose up
run tests

Pipelines blocked, integration failing, etc.
Modern application - complex interaction of microservices and AWS services. Predicting how it will work with unit tests becoming harder. Integration tests failing.

Validate an artifact vs validate an environment.

PR -> Build -> Provision and test -> Results

Clare bot:
- PR with docs
- bobby-drop-tables How do I view it etc
- Clare bot "Preview this" -> Provision. Codebuild.
- Tear down stack after.
