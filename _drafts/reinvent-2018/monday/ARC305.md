Serverless architecture patterns.

Intro:
Advantages:
- Management, flexible scaling, availability, no idle capcity (cost)

Lambda execution life cycle

Cold start: Download your code, start container, bootstrap runtime, start code.

CPU is proportional of memory for Lambda.

github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning : useful for finding right about of memory to allocate.
Size matters because of the 'download your code' step.

jackson-jr rather than jackson for smaller footprint. Try dagger.
Reduce startup cost from dependency injection (dagger)

SAM + deployment preferences.

Pattern 1: Web application.
Cloudfront + S3 for static content.
Api Gateway + lambda + DyDb

API Gateway - Edge optimised?
