Splitting up monolith using containers
Go Pro example - Cameras for sports. Video upload.

Spiky traffic, slow uploads, blocked video processing. Single repo. Dependencies between PRs, contention between teams
PR, code review, QA, security. Waiting - competition for time
Common services - breaking out parts.

When it goes well
Scaling, automation, faster development, easier adoption.

When it doesn't go well:
	- How organisations set up. Mistakes.
	- Script for deploying containers. Supposed to be modular. Monolith containers! :D Distributed monolith problem. Change control (HPSM tickets for everyone). Updating one thing means updating other things.
	- Monolith deployments just even more complicated now.
	- Different teams different tools for deployments.

How do you go about support in a world of microservices, with teams developing using different tools/tech/stacks?
