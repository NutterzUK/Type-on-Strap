Speakers
Robert Chow - Product owner for SNS SQS

Scenarios:
Black Friday - big peaks. Hard to plan for. Serverless scaled automatically, no infrastructure to manage etc.

What is SQS / SNS
Event-driven architecture

Message filtering
Tag messages in SNS that can then be filtered by consumers (E.g I only want messages with tag of blah)
Default limits of throughput of SNS.
Fan out ratio 12 million
Filters - soft limit of 200 per account.


Event processing
Lambda polls SQS for us.
Lambda removes message, processes it.
Using concurrency limit for throttling - e.g if lambda needs a downstream database so it doesn't hammer it.
Multiple queues can have different priority.


lambda starts at 5 then scaled up 60 per minute.
lambda starts polling, using long polling.
Use message batching to then have less lambda excecutions running to reduce concurrent limit roblems
Beware of Lambda cold start.

Sns -> Lambda vs SNS -> SQS -> Lambda.
SNS to lambda: Downstream customers are not rate constrained. Message is deleted even if procesing fails.
