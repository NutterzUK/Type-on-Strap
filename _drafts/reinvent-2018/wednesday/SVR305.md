Typical old school - ELB, EC2, RDS.

"Modern Applications"
1. Security/compliance first
2. Use microservices
3. Serverless where possible
4. CI/CD
5. Monitor, monitor, monitor!

6. Databases
7. Integration interfaces

How SQS works, front end, back end, load manager, dynamodb.
Strict ordering not being available is because it's split across clusters.
There was a time SQS was based on an Oracle database. Because it has well defined contracts and is based on microservices they could do that easily.

Database migrations are hard? Not if we use microservices.

Why serverless?
1. Frugality
2. Security - no old hosts unpatched etc.
3. Elasticity - no more capacity planning.
4. Better design?

Frees you up from maintaining things so you have more time to focus on business logic, end up with a better result.
